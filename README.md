# Pothole-Detection
Potholes are highly hazardous road surface conditions that prevent safe, secure, and reliable transportation and movement of people, goods, and services. Potholes on the road surface endanger the safety and comfort of most drivers and commuters. Poor road networks impede the smooth movement of goods and services, contributing to the economy's slow growth and development, whereas good road networks provide access to markets and enable fast and smooth transportation of goods and services from producers to consumers. Early detection and maintenance of potholes contributes to the creation of a reliable and safe road network that allows for the smooth movement of people, goods, and services.
Our goal here is to develop a pothole detection system using various image processing techniques that will serve as a framework to assist drivers avoid potholes on poorly constructed roads. Our dataset consists of a collection of low-angle images captured by a camera that serves as an image sensor and is mounted in front of the vehicle. Pothole detection system using image processing techniques is a solution to automate the surveillance of roads (particularly potholes) to help speed up the process of road assessment, which would lead to safer roads and faster road maintenance.
